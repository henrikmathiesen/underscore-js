                http://underscorejs.org/#debounce debounce_.debounce(function, wait, [immediate]) Creates and returns a new debounced version
                of the passed function which will postpone its execution until after wait milliseconds have elapsed since
                the last time it was invoked. Useful for implementing behavior that should only happen after the input has
                stopped arriving. For example: rendering a preview of a Markdown comment, recalculating a layout after the
                window has stopped being resized, and so on. At the end of the wait interval, the function will be called
                with the arguments that were passed most recently to the debounced function. Pass true for the immediate
                argument to cause debounce to trigger the function on the leading instead of the trailing edge of the wait
                interval. Useful in circumstances like preventing accidental double-clicks on a "submit" button from firing
                a second time.
