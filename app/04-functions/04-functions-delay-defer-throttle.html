            <p>
                http://underscorejs.org/#delay delay_.delay(function, wait, *arguments) Much like setTimeout, invokes function after wait
                milliseconds. If you pass the optional arguments, they will be forwarded on to the function when it is invoked.
            </p>
            <p>
                http://underscorejs.org/#defer defer_.defer(function, *arguments) Defers invoking the function until the current call stack
                has cleared, similar to using setTimeout with a delay of 0. Useful for performing expensive computations
                or HTML rendering in chunks without blocking the UI thread from updating. If you pass the optional arguments,
                they will be forwarded on to the function when it is invoked.
            </p>
            <p>
                http://underscorejs.org/#throttle throttle_.throttle(function, wait, [options]) Creates and returns a new, throttled version
                of the passed function, that, when invoked repeatedly, will only actually call the original function at most
                once per every wait milliseconds. Useful for rate-limiting events that occur faster than you can keep up
                with. By default, throttle will execute the function as soon as you call it for the first time, and, if you
                call it again any number of times during the wait period, as soon as that period is over. If you'd like to
                disable the leading-edge call, pass {leading: false}, and if you'd like to disable the execution on the trailing-edge,
                pass {trailing: false}.
